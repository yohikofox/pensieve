/**
 * TranscriptionQueueProcessor - Auto-enqueue captures for transcription
 *
 * Architecture (ADR-019):
 * - Subscribes to CaptureRecorded events via EventBus
 * - Automatically enqueues audio captures for background transcription
 * - Lifecycle: Transient (new instance per DI resolve)
 * - State: Stateless (subscription managed via start/stop)
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Listen for CaptureRecorded events
 * - Filter audio captures (ignore text captures)
 * - Enqueue via TranscriptionQueueService
 * - Handle errors gracefully (log, don't crash)
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const processor = new TranscriptionQueueProcessor(queueService, eventBus);
 * processor.start(); // Begin listening
 * // ... app lifecycle
 * processor.stop(); // Cleanup on app shutdown
 * ```
